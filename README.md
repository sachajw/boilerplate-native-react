**React Native Boilerplate (work in progress)**

---

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have all the relevant [emulators setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) - Installing Dependencies Section
2. Make sure you have Yarn [installed locally](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started)
3. Run **yarn install**
4. Run **npx pod-install ios**
5. Start the project: **yarn ios**

---

## Bootstrap

Setup the project with the standard [React Native CLI Quickstart](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

---

## Added Libraries

We have started to setup the project with the following libraries, but this can and will probably change:

1. [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
2. [RxJS](http://reactivex.io/)
3. [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - for unit testing
3. [Detox](https://github.com/wix/Detox) - for e2e testing (still needs to be added)

---

## TODO

The following still needs to be done within the boilerplate

1. Add Detox
2. Make sure the project works with Bitrise for CI/CD
3. Structure the components into the correct logical architecture
4. Add types to all the components
5. Document all the steps you are doing
6. ..

As we work together on this boilerplate, please keep the README file up to date, and also elaborate on this as we go along.

We will use the standard Feature Branch Flow to make sure we do not run into each other.
